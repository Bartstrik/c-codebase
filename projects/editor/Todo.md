next steps:


-make it possible to navigate through a bigger file, as in have the whole window shift over when reaching one of the edges of the window
-update draw_screen to only write changes 
-update read_input() function to :
    -write the input text to the screen
    -write the input text to the data set, which at this moment will also make it write to the screen
-add ability to insert enter key as newline

-create a write buffer for performance
-create a backup routine

-find out how not to use relative paths for includes etc.
